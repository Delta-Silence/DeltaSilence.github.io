            <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
            <p>Sights of Iron was created by an indie studio known as Delta Silence. We started off independent, making mods for a game called Pavlov VR in Unreal Engine 5. One day, one of our founders, Dadarkest got an idea that we should make a PvP shooter with assets based off a mix of modern and historical items. With the experience in UE5, we figured we would take the challenge of making a shooter game with just two developers. Dadarkest as the game designer, and Exturnix as the one in charge of the programming. Thats where we leave off for now as the game is still a work in progress but we hope to have something big in the future.</p>
